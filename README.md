# Garmmer-Toolkit
The toolkit, implemented in Java, supports sentence generation with coverage criteria, sentence enumeration and sentence analysis for context-free grammars.

## Usage

 Jre 6 (Jre1.6) is required, which is available at http://java.sun.com/.

 The toolkit can be used as a Java library or an application.

* As a library, it would be added into classpath.
* As an application, it can be open with javaw directly, namely java(TM) Platform SE binary,
or be used from the command-line:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
    javaw -jar Toolkit.jar or java -jar Toolkit.jar
```
