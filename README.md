# Garmmer-Toolkit
The toolkit, implemented in Java, supports sentence generation with coverage criteria, sentence enumeration and sentence analysis for context-free grammars.

## Usage

 The toolkit can be used as a Java library or an application.

* As a library, it would be added into classpath.
* As an application, it can be open with javaw directly, namely java(TM) Platform SE binary,
or be used from the command-line:
